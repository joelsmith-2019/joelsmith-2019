# About Me
Hello, my name is Joel and I am a college student in my senior year working towards my bachelor of science in software development. Since middle school, I have been programming Minecraft servers and exploring computers in general. This interest in technology has continued and led me to pursue my current degree at Grand Canyon University. As of now, I am actively looking for an opportunity to broaden my skills and perspective in the software field.
